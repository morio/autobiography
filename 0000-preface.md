# Preface
This is my autobiography.

That statement is significant to me.

This is also an Open Book.

Also significant to me.

I am me and we are humanity. Scientifically by DNA.

We are life. Thus, all earthly nature that shares DNA is also life.

Our cousin RNA (viruses), are not life.

Now onto my story.

Thank you.
